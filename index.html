<span style="font-size:12px;font-weight:bolder;">"A MacGuffin is a plot device used in
  films or books that sets the characters into motion and drives
  the story. <br>A MacGuffin is an object, idea, person, or goal that
  the characters are either in pursuit of or which serves as<br>
  motivation for their actions. Usually, the MacGuffin is revealed in the first act.</span>

A MacGuffin can be a secret instigator for the characters, but the audience does not necessarily need to care about it.

<span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10px;">Hitchcock was a master of pure cinema who almost never failed to reconcile aesthetics with the demands of the box-office. </span>

<div class="text-align">
<span style="font-size:30px;"><br>Always formally dressed, wearing a suit on film sets<br>
Inspired the adjective "Hitchcockian" for suspense thrillers<br>
He hated to shoot on location. He preferred to shoot at the studio where he could have full control of lighting and other factors.<br> This is why even his later films contain special effects composite and rear screen shots.
<br>Distinctively slow way of speaking, dark humor and dry wit, especially regarding murder.</span>
